# OrionOpenSource
## Orion OAJS scripts that are open for anyone to use or alter as they see fit
### written by Roger Howard

**All scripts contained within this repository are free and open source, please feel free to use, alter, or redistrubute any and all of these code files.**
**My code is written with love and never intended to be used nefariously.  Please be responsible and considerate of others while using these tools.**

Some common conventions I use:
 - variable names always begin lowercase, function names always begin uppercase
 - code blocks are indented by one tab
 - opening braces { are always on the same line as the statement
 - closing braces } are always on their own line unless followed by more code from the block (else if/else)
 - variables are always defined at the top of a function, globals at the top of the file
 - links to other code files can be included using Orion's tag feature: //#includes filename.oajs
